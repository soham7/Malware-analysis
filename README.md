This is a repository in which I've uploaded the reports for malware and malware oriented traffic analysis.
The url for packet captures for traffic: https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/tutorials/index.html
For malwares, the urls are mentioned in IOCs. The folders are named after the most prolific names of the malware/traffic, it contains the IOCs, the snapshot supporting the IOCs, and the packet capture itself.
