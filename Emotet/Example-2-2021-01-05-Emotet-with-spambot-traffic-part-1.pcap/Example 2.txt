Similar to sample 1, we applied the filetr:
(http.request or http.response or tls.handshake.type eq 1) and !(ssdp)

A GET request was found without a response (filtering application in content type of http object list):
Host: miprimercamino.com
Filename: AJ09AzChrK

Although, the application was saved; it couldnt be seen it the directory or been hashed.

Around 17 minutes of spambot activity is seen.

No un-encrypted smtp traffic found for this sample.
